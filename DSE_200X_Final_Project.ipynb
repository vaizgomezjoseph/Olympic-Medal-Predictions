    "Now that you have a better understanding of the data, you will want to form a research question which is interesting to you. The research question should be broad enough to be of interest to a reader but narrow enough that the question can be answered with the data.  Some examples:\n",
    "* **Too Narrow:**  *What is the GDP of the U.S. for 2011?*  This is just asking for a fact or a single data point.  \n",
    "* **Too Broad:**  *What is the primary reason for global poverty?*  This could be a Ph.D. thesis and would still be way too broad.  What data will you use to answer this question?  Even if a single dataset offered an answer, would it be defendable given the variety of datasets out there?\n",
    "* **Good (just right):**  *Can you use sentiment analysis on comments about movies on Twitter to predict its box office earnings?*  If you have, or can obtain, tweets which refer to a variety of movies and you have their box office earnings, this is a question which you can potentially answer well.\n",

For example, if you are looking for a relationship between two items (say, CO2 emissions and GDP), you may wish to use scatter plots and statistical correlation.  If you are trying to predict an outcome based on input data, you’ll need to identify the appropriate methods from the week on Machine Learning.  Be sure to document, in your notebook, your research methods."

Are you making assumptions about the data which may, or may not, be valid (e.g., that students in one term are equally qualified as students in another)?  Document these limitations."

    "Fill in this slide template to present your project (*hyperlink was here*).  Feel free to add more slides, but aim to keep your entire presentation **below 20 total slides**.  We also recommend you attach a PDF of your Jupyter notebook to this presentation in one single PDF file to be uploaded. As you are writing, please follow the guidelines below:\n",
    "## General Guidelines for Project Reports and Presentations:\n",
    "1. This is academic writing. Keep it formal and coherent as a self-contained entity. Anyone reading your presentation should have a full understanding of the question, approach and the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Be professional. You should be comfortable giving this presentation to the general public, your boss, or your academic advisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write for a diverse audience including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **General Public:** Reads only the title and abstract looking for high-level point mainly for conversational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **A company CEO:** Reads introduction, research question, findings and conclusions looking for business value and details related to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **An academic advisor (or company CTO):** Reads the full presentation AND your Jupyter Notebook paying particular attention to technical coherence, academic value, and technical data science strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final presentation should also be for the above-mentioned three audiences. Think of the diversity of the audience. The whole point is to **tell a story** - so you should motivate a reader to care based on the question you are exploring, answer that question in a clear and concise manner, provide an honest appraisal of your results, and give the reader valuable insights.  Use charts whenever possible. Avoid slides with a lot of text and bullet points - break the slide into multiple slides when this happens.  Be concise!"
